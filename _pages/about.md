Hi! I'm Qi Zhang, a PhD candidate at Tsinghua University, Beijing in the [School of Safety Science](https://www.ssafs.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm). I'm a self-motivated and passionate individual looking to pursue knowledge about thermal runaway of lithium-ion batteries. I'm a current PhD candidate with a palpable desire to research into toxicity of ultrafine particles and simulation of thermal runaway scenarios.

You can find my CV here: [Qi Zhang-Academic CV](../assets/cv-zq_v3.pdf).
