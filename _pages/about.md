Hi! I'm Qi Zhang, a graduate student at Tsinghua University, Beijing in the [Department of Engineering Physics](https://www.ep.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I'm a self-motivated and passionate individual looking to pursue a PhDâ€™s in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. I'm a current post-graduate student with a palpable desire to research into Applied Statistics, specifically the data analysis area. The presentation made in the professional course was praised and recommended by the professor for submission to the National Conference on Big Data and Social Computing, which further strengthened my extensive motivation and ambition for research. Experience in data analysis research as well as presenting at conferences and constructing research papers.
